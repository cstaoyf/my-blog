title: "Accelerating a Type of DP"

When a DP recursive structure satisfies the so-called "Quadrangle inequality" and "monotone property", then it can be accelerated. This was originally observed by 

F.F. Yao, Speed-up in dynamic programming, SIAM J. Alg. Discrete Math. 3 (1982) 532-540. 

A nice account is provided in 

S. V. Nagaraj: Optimal Binary Search Trees. Theor. Comput. Sci. 188(1-2): 1-44 (1997).
