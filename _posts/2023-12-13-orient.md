Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. An *orientation* gives a direction to each edge in $G$, thereby creating a directed graph $G' = (V, E')$. If $G'$ has the max-outdegree $d$, the orientation is a $d$-*orientation*. Let $d^*$ be the smallest $d$ possible. 

The following paper 

Lukasz Kowalik: Approximation Scheme for Lowest Outdegree Orientation and Graph Density Measures. ISAAC 2006: 557-566

shows how to compute a $d \cdot (1 + \epsilon)$-orientation in time $O(\frac{E}{\epsilon} \cdot \log V \cdot \log d^*)$ time. This is achieved by performing binary search on $d$. The crucial subroutine is a "test" function which, assuming the existence of a $d$-orientation, returns a $d \cdot (1+\epsilon)$-orientation. By resorting to the max-flow problem and applying Dinic's algorithm, each test can be performed efficiently. 

See [here](https://cstaoyf.github.io/my-blog/pdf/k97-orient.pdf) for my markdown pdf of the above paper. 

The paper also contains a gental introduction to (i) the related concepts of pseudo-forest and pseudo-arboricity, and (ii) the connections between edge orientation and computing pseudo-arboricity, arboricity, and graph density.
